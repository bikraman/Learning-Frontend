I'd like to add:

Events vs callbacks and the tradeoffs of each

strategies for reducing page reflows

Avoiding dangling event handlers - jQuery has made us all lazy so many don't know it does a ton of cleanup for you

what 'this' refers to and how it is controlled using call and apply

Mixins vs prototypal inheritance

Importance of Templates (mustache / handlebars / whatever hint: separation of concerns)

can talk about an MV* library and what parts of code belong in each, model, view, controller check out http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/ for some examples

Asynchronous control flow

Those are a few off the top of my head. Hope that helps

Like the DOM, XHR, Webstorage, Web messaging and so on

If I had to sum it up I would say: read the docs.

1. Read all of MDN
2. Read the spec
3. Read the documentation of any library, framework or tool you use

Set aside 1 hour a day, every day, to work through these 3 things.

Doing this will put you above 90% of JS programmers. Because most donâ€™t do this. They jump in and try to make things work. Which is faster in the short term but slower in the long term.

The best programmers I worked with had taken the time to read the documentation.

1. Concepts of microtasks and macrotasks are interesting and worth a google.
2. Learn how to use map, filter and reduce with arrays.

Senior dev, CTO of a startup, handler of all technical interviews here:

Here are the questions I will ask during my interviews:

1. Generic programming knowledge questions to make sure you aren't a fraud. I will ask you about some of the common data structures in the language either you are proficient in, or that I am specifically hiring for. These questions apply more to the junior roles as I care much more about soft skills as a senior dev. If you start to look like a fraud to me I can get into some specific leet code type stuff to see if you even know how to program.

2. Framework specific knowledge questions to see if you have used the frameworks my company cares about or is invested in. If you provide contrary opinions during the interview about why my tech choices such I will inquire further to see if you are able to solve a problem I didn't know I had.

3. Tooling specific knowledge questions about how we build and shop our products. This will be questions about various package managers and build automation tooling, documentation generators, infrastructure as code, and deployment tools and theories such as CI and CD. These aren't hard requirements since you are a developer and not OPs, but I want to make sure you can at least play nice with our Ops people or even if you can contribute there. Again, looking for solutions to problems I didn't know I had.

4. Business problem specific questions. If my company has a problem and we are trying to hire our way out of that problem, I'll ask you specific questions related to that problem to see if you are the person we can hire to solve this problem. Failing to answer these correctly won't lose you the job, it just loses you some bonus points.

5. Culture questions since we value professionals who can work in a team. This is especially important for senior devs since you will be providing mentorship and training to the more junior developers. I want to know that you aren't going to reduce the overall performance of our teams because "that is the way things have always been done". We are always growing as individuals, teams, and as a company. Everyone here knows something that no one else knows and we are all constantly excited to share that knowledge with each other. Being able to mentor juniors is valuable, but also so is being able to learn from your juniors constantly. You won't know everything you need to know when I hire you, so I need to be able to make sure you can learn on the job and adapt to changing business requirements or whatever. I don't really care if you can implement JSON.stringify, but if we find ourselves in that pinch I need to know you can figure it out and make something work.

6. Lastly I want to talk about your experiences and resume highlights to make sure you are learning from both your successes and failures, and can bring some of those lessons learned over to our company. I want to hear that you have challenged yourself, and that sometimes you have won and sometimes you have lost. Since you have had a gap in experience I want to make sure you can still bring value from those past projects, if not then we won't count that towards your seniority and we might try to hire you as an intermediate dev with the potential to quickly promote to senior dev again if you perform well. You can compensate for this with a personal project portfolio if you need to. But I won't pay you a senior dev salary just because you have been an adult for 20+ years, you will need to bring the hard or soft skills to the table to earn that paycheck, but if you are confident you can quickly get back to that point make sure to communicate that in the interview!
